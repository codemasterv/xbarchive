# xbarchive
archive.org links

This is a helper tool to access Archive.org files
This is early in build so its pretty basic.
It will allow you to get xbox stuff in bulk from archive.org

You will need ubuntu or deb based linux. Windows Subsystem Linux will work but you will need to install that yourself.

HowTo:

    git clone https://github.com/codemasterv/xbarchive.git

    cd xbarchive
    
    sudo chmod +x mogi_xbox.sh
    
    sh mogi_xbox.sh
    
Select a number 0-5 and hit enter. 

**HINT: You need to hit 0 first**

The program will create and download the files in the created directory.

Option 4 will remove all folders but leave the script
